WE have a total of 5 protocols:
- IV curve:
    - no imaging
    - in VC from -80mv to 20mv in st
    - 1 s pulses
    - protocol total length ~60s 
- Area of light approx ~0.180 mm^2
    - circle of ~480 microns diameter
    - this is not exact
    - decay from peak from center
    - FWHM ~250 um 
- Chrimson Photocurrents
    - No imaging (only used to control light intesity through micromanager)
    - 20Hz pulses at pulse widths    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 50, 50, 50] (last three are end up 1s long conninuous light)
    - 5 light intensities logarithmically spaced from 5% to 100%
    - done in "mirror" filter
    - max intensity yellow light 3760 uW (100%) (~ 20.88 mW/mm^2)
- Chrimson Crosstalk
    - No imaging (only used to control light intesity through micromanager)
    - 1 pulse 1s and 100Hz 10 pulses
    - cyan light
    - 6 light intensities logarithmically spaced from 5% to 100%. 3 repeats per instensity
    - light power in mirror 100% is 5210 uW 
- GCaMP Cell attached:
    - Current clamp mode
    - 2000 pA current injection
    - train rates = [1,2,4,8,10]
    - durations = [4,3,2,1,0.4] 
    - pulses = [4,6, 8, 8, 4]
    - light intensity 10% in cyan light. 5210 uW = 100% (~28.9mW/mm^2)
    - GPF filter
    - 60Hz imaging
    - exposure 7ms
    - External triggering of frames
    - 1 sweep = ~20s
- All optical
    - Dual bandpass dicroic filter
    - 60Hz imaging

    - External triggering of frames
    - 1 sweep = ~13s
    - Cyan light ~10% (100% is 5340 uW) (~29.6mW/mm^2)
    - Yellow light 
        - 5% to 100% (100% is 346 uW) **This is way dimmer than in mirror mode**
        - **Just noticed green light is way brighter through this filter** ~5100uW = 100% (~28.6mW/mm^2)
        - 100% is 1.922 mW/mm^2
        - All trains at 10Hz for 1 sec
        - pulse widths= [1,2,3,5] ms
        - light intensitites logarithmically spaced 6 intensities.
